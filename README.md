## Creating a New Module

```bash
create-svelte-library
```

Answer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:

* copy over the template
* install dependencies via yarn or npm
* link packages together for local development
* initialize local git repo

## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to build your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm run build # runs rollup
```

The second part will be running the `example/` sapper that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
cd example
npm run dev # runs sapper dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, sapper will reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

#### Publishing to npm

```bash
npm publish
```

This builds `commonjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.
